# Find an RSA Private Key
## Challenge
`https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/cracking-rsa-a-challenge-generator-2b64c4edb3e7`

Below was a challenge from the article:
```
Encryption parameters
e:              65537
N:              1034776851837418228051242693253376923
Cipher:         582984697800119976959378162843817868
We are using    60 bit primes
```
The first game was to calculate the factors of N.  After that, and more hops, you would derive the Private Key.  With that key you would decrypt the ciphertext into plaintext.  Revealing a secret message! üïµüèº‚Äç.

## Goal
My first goal was to take a user entered `N` and attempt to find `P` and `Q` without blowing up my computer.  This was harder than I imagined but hitting each roadblock was actually fun.

This whole exercise was about BIG numbers.  Actually, in this setup, I was using tiny numbers compared to real-world RSA implementations.
```

1034776851837418228051242693253376923 = 1086027579223696553 x 952809000096560291
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
## Design steps
#### Attempt 1: the Naive Trial Division Algorithm
After receiving a positive, large `N`, my app attempted to follow the same code path as a thousand other StackOverflow readers.  This was cynically (and probably fairly) labelled the `the Naive Trial Division Algorithm` by people who understood the Math Theory behind this problem.  I was not one of the blessed.  I was hit every bump on the journey.

#### The number N
Assumptions about the `N` number:
 - [x] Not a negative
 - [x] Not even [as this implies there was a non-prime input (100 = 5 * 20)]
 - [x] Not a prime number

#### Brainstorm
My was to write super simple code.

- verify that N was not even
- check every odd number less than < ( N / 2 )
- remove 1, 2 from possible primes
- check whether I could divide N / odd number and get a zero remainder
- checked whether the found odd number was a prime

In summary:

```
‚úÖ [3, 11] = 33       // find both prime factors but not 1 or 2
‚úÖ [3, 13] = 39       // same as previous
üî∏ [3,9] = 27         // discount 9 as a Prime Factor
üî∏ [5, 20] = 100      // stop as N was even
```

#### Code setup
I wrote a mix of C and Objective-C code.  xCode was the IDE.  That allowed me to apply existing `Object Orientated` APIs like a `run-loop` and `background threading` to kill my app and keep the U.I. refreshing.  I could have written everything in C but it would take longer and I found my C code would become spaghetti without `Objects` to keep things structured.

Using a few in built Objective-C APIs, I created a kill timer.  It was set to 20 minutes.  This was my fail-safe to `N` values that were too large.

I didn't attempt use existing third party libraries to tell me if a number was prime.

#### Results == Bugs üêú üêú üêú
Status| Number (N) | Primes
--|---|--
üêù| 3000009  |  3 * 1000003
üêù| 101003333 |  101 * 1000033
üêç| 7919261327 |  7919 * 1000033
üêç| 17746761831 |  3 * 5915587277                              

I got a crazy value shown when I tried to find the factors of `7919261327`.  Why?  Almost 8 billion.  I had the common sense to check the limits of C Types (good reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/data-type-ranges?view=vs-2017).

I picked the `Unsigned Long Long`.  Any variable of that type could store up to `18,446,744,073,709,551,615`.  18 billion billion.  20 decimal digits. Big.

Well, I made several errors with the same root cause.  I had used `int` and `unsigned long long` C Types interchangeably.  For your amusement, my bugs were the following:

```
BUG 1: int val = atoi(str);
// return type was `int`

BUG 2: for(int i = floor_limit; i <= upper_limit; i += 2)
// `i` was set to `int` when it was going to increment beyond the max integer

BUG 3: printf ("[+]%d is a factor \n", i);
// I told `printf` the input was an `int` when I sent it huge `unsigned long long` values
// this was one of those compiler warnings you just skip over...
```
#### More results ==  harder bugs üêú
I religiously purged my code of `int` types.  I tried to speed up my search loop.

Status| Number (N) | Primes | Time taken
--|---|--|--
üêù| 505371799 | 16127 * 31337 | 1 second
üêù| 7919261327 | 7919 * 1000033  | 19 seconds
üêú| 10175656859 | 100033 * 101723 | 25 seconds. Failed to find all factors
üêù| 17746761831 | 3 * 5915587277  | 72 seconds
üêú| 8069212743871 |  2840261 * 2841011 (7) | Found factors but timed out.
üêú| 100001880003211 | 10000019 * 10000169 (8) | Found factors but timed out.

Why was `8069212743871` not able to finish ?

In 20 minutes, my computer running was able to check `N` values of up to ~220 billion.  Give or take a billion.  This was a long way off the (8 trillion / 2) I asked for it to check.  Let say the crude calculation was:

```
(8 trillion / 2) == upper_limit (4 trill)
4 trill / 220 bill == 18.1
20 minutes * 18.1 = 362 minutes
362 = 6 hours
```

#### Brute Force is slow
I set my kill timer to 10 hours, while I slept.  My crude calculation was accurate enough.

Status| Number (N) | Primes | Time taken
--|---|--|--
üêù| 8069212743871 |  2840261 * 2841011 (7) | 5 hours.

How long to calculate `100001880003211` which is just over 100 trillion?
```
100 trill / 2 == upper_limit
upper_limit / 4 trill == 12.5
12.5 * 6 hours == 75 hours.
```
Using my crude calculation again, with 2 x Primes of 8-digits, my `N` value would take over **3 days** to exhaust all possible `N` values.

## Summary of the Naive Trial Division Algorithm
In summary, on small values, like most code on StackOverflow, my code worked.  But when I grew the size of N == 2 primes of 8 or more digits, my CPU would have to run at 99% for many days and weeks!

The `Naive Trial Division Algorithm` had no chance of dealing with a `60 bit primes`.  It took 5 hours to deal with an upper limit of 4 trillions   How would it cope when the upper limit of a longer prime, was a `60 bit prime` or even a `64 bit prime?`  The latter had a an upper limit of 18 quintillion (18 billion billion).

A fun example:
```
My computer could do 4 trillion in 5 hours
18 quintillion \ 4 trillion == 4.5 million
4.5 million * 5 hours = 2,500 years
```
**2,500 years** just to exhaust a single prime.  We need another way!  https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/courses/csci2824-spr14/pollardsRho.html


#### Problem 1 - size of N
Back to the challenge text:  `we are using 60 bit primes`.  The native `unsigned long` C type gave a ceiling of a positive, ~4 billion decimal value.  

Status| Number (N) | Primes | Time taken
--|---|--|--
üêç| 24212989121030676023 | 5915587277 * 4093082899  | Too big for my code
üêç| 2015994091679141905085000807307 | 3 * 671998030559713968361666935769   | Too big for my code

Another way to say it:
```
C Type unsigned long  (max 4294967295):
11111111111111111111111111111111  (32 bits)

C Type unsigned long long (max 18446744073709551615)
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 (64 bits)

A 65 bit prime (29497513910652490397):
11001100101011100001110001001111000000001100101011101001010011101 (65 bits)
```
Remember `P * Q = N`.  I could probably get away with `unsigned long long` for P and Q ( 60-65 bits each) but how would I even define N as variable when it was so much bigger than the either of those values ?  

```
N = P * Q
812434587229347807826931000341281416581 = 29497513910652490397 * 27542476619900900873
N = 130 bits
```
Step forward the **gmp** library.  I also considered `openSSL's` inbuilt number functionality but I didn't want to unpick the `openssl` security or networking code.  I expected that decision to bite later as I would probably need a key generation and decrypt function to test my code.

#### Other solutions?
So I didn't send my machine into warp speed and melt the CPU, I found better methods to achieve what I wanted. This article really changed my approach.
**https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/courses/csci2824-spr14/pollardsRho.html**
You could use the `Birthday Paradox` to give you an efficient, *probabilistic* method to achieve the same.  **probabilistic**, huh?  The code could fail.  But it could work the next time you ran the code.  Fun?
#### Factors of N
There were multiple ways to achieve this.  My code was primitive so I changed it to the `Pollard Rho Algorithm`.

I purposely added an `observer` to check whether the code to find factors of a large number had been found.  I ran the  find factors on a background thread, to avoid blocking the UI thread.

#### Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test
This already had the `primality test` code.  This was a `probabilistic primality test`.  Hence, the code had a watchdog to catch when the code could not determine an answer.
```
/*     printing of result ( reps ) in the form of                    */
/* reps = 2          if n is definitely prime                        */
/* reps = 1          if n is probably prime (without being certain)  */
/* reps = 0          if n is definitly composite. There should be it.*/
```
I also read that `Reasonable values of reps are between 15 and 50.` on `https://machinecognitis.github.io/Math.Gmp.Native/html/52ce0428-7c09-f2b9-f517-d3d02521f365.htm`.

#### Test Vectors
```
Non-Prime Pair: [3,9] = 27
Primes : [3, 11] = 33
Primes : [13, 29] = 377
Primes : [467, 601] = 280667
Primes : [3461, 3319] = 11487059
Primes : [45095080578985454453, 36413321723440003717] = 1642061677267048469007620094567254201801
