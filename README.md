Here is an example:
```

```
##### Goal
Take N and establish P and Q, on calculate a background thread.
##### Design thoughts
After receiving a positive, large integer (N) the program attempted to:
```
-> verify that N was not even
-> Create an array of all odd numbers, less than N
-> remove 1 and from the array
-> Ensure only prime numbers were left
```
Although my code worked on small, valid large numbers generated by two primes I struggled to get an efficient way to remove non-prime numbers.  A lot of smarter people had already looked at this problem.  Refer to `The Miller Rabin primality test`.  I change my plan to re-use smarter code.

I purposely added an `observer` to check whether the code to find two prime factors of a large number had been found.  I also did this on a background queue, to avoid blocking the UI thread.
##### Millerâ€“Rabin primality test
As I was dealing in large, decimal literals (Base 10) I could not use any native C number types.  I used the `gmp` library.  This already had the `primality test` code.  This was a `probabilistic primality test`.  Hence, the code had a watchdog to catch when the code could not determine an answer.
```
/*                                                                   */
/*     printing of result ( reps ) in the form of                    */
/* reps = 2          if n is definitely prime                        */
/* reps = 1          if n is probably prime (without being certain)  */
/* reps = 0          if n is definitly composite. There should be it.*/
/*            
*/
```
I also read that `Reasonable values of reps are between 15 and 50.` on `https://machinecognitis.github.io/Math.Gmp.Native/html/52ce0428-7c09-f2b9-f517-d3d02521f365.htm`.

##### Test Vectors
```
Non-Prime Pair: [3,9] = 27
Primes : [3, 11] = 33
Primes : [13, 29] = 377
Primes : [467, 601] = 280667
Primes : [3461, 3319] = 11487059
Primes : [45095080578985454453, 36413321723440003717] = 1642061677267048469007620094567254201801
